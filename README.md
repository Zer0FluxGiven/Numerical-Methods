# Numerical-Methods

# Summary: This repository includes several python scripts that use numerical methods that solve problems in calculus, differential equations, and physics. 

# CONTENTS:

#0. 1D-Hamiltonian.py : This Python script solves and plots Hamilton's Equations in 1 degree of freedom

#1. 2D-Hamiltonian.py : This Python script solves and plots Hamilton's Equations in 2 degrees of freedom

#2. 2D-Ising-Model.py : This program uses a Monte-Carlo method to analyze the 2D-Ising Model

#3. Rutherford-Scattering.py: Simulate particle scattering due to central, inverse-square-law force
